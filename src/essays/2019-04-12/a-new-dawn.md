I left BlackRock after just over 7.5 years of working there. It was my first job out of school and was extremely formative in the kind of person I became. The latter can  be attributed to both, the trials-by-fire I underwent as well as the people I interacted with over the entire duration. 

A lot of people fall under the delusion that the progress they make is solely by virtue of the hard work and effort they put in. Little do they know the extent to which the people around them play a role, towards the accomplishment of those goals. The emphasis of how profound an impact that has, cannot be understated. I am eternally grateful to the people who had a hand, direct or indirect, in propping me up, helping me out, challenging me, calling out my bullsh*t, stimulating my brain and in general, just being a friendly soundboard against which I could bounce my ideas and state of mind. 

Now on to the next chapter where the hustle continues...
