It's fairly well known that schools and colleges do not teach a lot of practical "life stuff" especially when it comes to complex topics like Finance and Healthcare. In the absence of that information, there are a few ways people go about thinking of financial security: 
1. Listen to what their peer network does and follow some version of that
2. Not do anything in their 20s and then learn about new ways to invest in their 30s or 40s 
3. Take financial advice from professionals who help chart their course

My gut instinct tells me that the 1st and 2nd options are roughly the same high percentage, and the 3rd option is a very low percentage. 

The question I ask myself all the time, even now, is why is it so hard to get information that is specific to your situation? Why do you need professional advice for something that is seems fairly basic and fairly important for peace of mind? Our financial and medical systems are immensely complicated. Some of it is a function of years of complex legislation and some of it a product of intentional obfuscation to aid institutional investment and to prevent the common person from being able to make sense of it all by themselves. 

I'm going to take a stab at distilling what I have learned over the past 12 years, both as a means to document some of my practices, as well as provide an opinionated viewpoint, based on my own experiences. 

If I had to represent the path to financial security in discrete milestones - 
- L1: (No savings) Have basic access to food, water, shelter.
- L2: (Meager savings) Have enough to not have to constantly think about how you will get your next meal. However, you still need to work for a living. 
- L3: (Substantial savings) You are generally conmfortable and while you still need to work, you are starting to create healthy savings.  
- L4: (Lots of savings) You are very comfortable, and you are getting to the point where you don't need to work and some of your investments are starting to create passive income although those aren't necessarily life supporting yet.  
- L5: (Money on auto-pilot) You are extremely comfortable, and you are at the point where the returns your investments make you is more than sufficient.

 For a topic as huge as this, there are plenty of rabbit holes you can get into, but I will focus on the specific areas I looked into and did something about. In subsequent parts, I will give details of actions I took (or didn't take) as I traversed this ladder of financial health and things I would change or redo if I had the chance.
